       Starting today, the mail Icon that you are accustomed to seeing on the front page of the web apps portal will no longer be functional. 

Simply by typing in http://www.office.com in your browser of choice and logging in with your PEP credentials yields a world of functionality and productivity tools including your email.

For those of you that prefer a more traditional Outlook experience you still have the option of launching Outlook 2016 from your Applications.

The choice is yours. Feel free to customize your experience as you see fit by creating your own bookmarks and short cuts.
